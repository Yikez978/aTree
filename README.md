# aTree
Simple file/folder ACL auditing software. With the small, added bonus of reporting file/folder sizes too.

aTree recursively scans through a folder and reports on all files/subfolders, and the access control lists for each detected object.

The purpose is to provide a visualization of how user and group permissions are applied on large data repositories(such as shares on file servers), making it easier to understand the security in place.

It will report whom each access control entry is granting access, the type and level of access, and whether or not it's an explicit assignment, or inherited from a parent directory.

Basic filtering is in place, allowing a user to search for a specific folder by name, or to see what folder(s) a group may have access.

This is an ongoing side project, with many bugs, todos, cleanup, and potential improvements, but feel free to point anything out.
